System.out.println("Brock. You are an amazing person. I don't know how to code. But I do know how to write heckin print statements (well I guess this is just one really long one). Thanks for teaching us so much about the mysterious world of HTML. We are forever in your debt. I know not why you are missing, but I hope whatever it is soon resolves itself. If you are sick feel better, if you are sad get happy. You are a beautiful human being. Don't you ever forget it");
